(ns keechma.controller
  "Controllers in Keechma are the place where you put the code
  that has side-effects. They are managed by the [[keechma.controller-manager]]
  which will start them or stop them based on the current route.

  Each controller implements the `params` function. `params` function returns
  a subset of the route params that are the controller is interested in.

  For instance let's say that you have a `UserController` which should be
  running only when the user is on the route `/users`:

  ```clojure
  ;; let's say that your routes are defined like this:
  
  (def routes [\":page\"]) ;; Routes are managed by the app-state library.

  ;; When user goes to the url `/users` the params function would receive
  ;; something that looks like this:

  {:data {:page \"users\"}}

  ;; `params` function returns `true` only when user is on the `:page` \"users\"
  (defrecord UserController [])

  (defmethod controller/params UserController [_ route-params]
    (when (= \"users\" (get-in route-params [:data :page]))
     true))
  ```

  When `params` function returns a non `nil` value the controller will be started:

  1. Controller's `start` function will be synchronously called with the current
  application state. This function returns a new version of the state if needed.
  (if the `start` function is not doing any changes to the app-state it must return
  the received version)
  2. Controller's `handler` function will be called - this function will receive
  application state atom, channel through which the controller receives the commands
  (`in-chan`) and the channel through which the controller can send commends to
  other controllers (`out-chan`).

  When `params` function returns a `nil` value that instance of the controller will
  be stopped:

  1. Controller's `stop` function will be synchronously called with the current
  application state. This function returns a new version of the state if needed - 
  use this function to clean up any data loaded by the controller (if the `stop` 
  function is not doing any changes to the app-state it must return the received
  version).
  2. Controller's `in-chan` (through which it can receive commands) will be closed.

  Controller's `start` and `stop` functions can asynchronuously send commends to the
  controller. Calling `(execute controller-instance :command)` will put that command
  on the controller's `in-chan`. Controller can react to these commands from the 
  `handler` function."
